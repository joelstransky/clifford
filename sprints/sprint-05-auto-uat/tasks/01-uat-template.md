# Task 01: Sprint UAT Template

## Title
Define the standardized UAT markdown structure.

## Context
Each sprint needs a `uat.md` file that acts as a living document for task verification.

## Step-by-Step
1. Create a template for `uat.md`.
2. The template should have a header for the Sprint Name and ID.
3. It should include a placeholder or structure that allows the Developer agent to append sections for each task.
4. Each task section must include:
   - Task ID and Title.
   - Status (Completed/Failed).
   - Summary of changes.
   - Verification results (from `sprint-verify.sh`).
   - A checkbox for Human Sign-off.

## Verification
- Verify the template is clear.
- Ensure it is placed in a location where the scaffolder can find it (e.g., `templates/`).
