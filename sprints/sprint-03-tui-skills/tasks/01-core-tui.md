# Task 01: Core TUI Layout

## Title
Build the split-screen TUI dashboard.

## Context
A TUI is needed to manage ASM and provide a robust environment for Workflow A. It will replace raw terminal interactions.

## Step-by-Step
1. Use `ink` to create a dashboard with a split-screen layout.
2. Left side: Display the `manifest.json` (Sprint Plan) with live status indicators.
3. Right side: Display real-time agent logs and any active blockers.
4. Ensure the layout handles resizing and scrolling gracefully.

## Verification
- Run the TUI and verify the split-screen layout appears correctly with sample data.
